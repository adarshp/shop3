# A command-line argument to load a file in Lisp.  For Allegro Lisp,

# Location of SHOP2.  This can be the complete path and file name of
# the shop2.lisp file.  Alternatively, you may omit the .lisp
# extension; in this case many Lisp environments will automatically
# load a compiled version of SHOP2 if one is available.  See your Lisp
# manual for more details.
