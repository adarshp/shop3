This set of problems corresponds to the 2000 IPC satellite-strips-automatic set of problems, available [here](https://github.com/potassco/pddl-instances/blob/master/ipc-2002/domains/satellite-strips-automatic/).

The domain model, though, is based on the ADL domain description.

The lisp versions of the domains have been automatically translated.  The code involved is included here.
